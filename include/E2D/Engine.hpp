/**
 * @defgroup engine Engine module
 * @brief Manages the main game loop and high-level systems integration in the E2D game engine.
 *
 * The Engine module is responsible for orchestrating the main game loop, integrating core systems such as rendering,
 * input handling, physics, and audio. It serves as the central hub that coordinates various subsystems to work together
 * seamlessly. The Engine module ensures that the game's components are updated and rendered in a consistent and
 * synchronized manner, providing a robust framework for game development.
